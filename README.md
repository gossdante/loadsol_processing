# University of Virginia Loadsol Processing Code
This program was written to ingest text files from the Loadapp software created by Novel. This script when provided with a force threshold and participant weight will isolate individual steps on the left and right leg then create several spatiotemporal and kinetic variables. 

The program is accessible here: https://uva-loadsol-processing.streamlit.app/
